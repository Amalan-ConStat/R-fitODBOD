## Modelling

To demonstrate the process the Alcohol Consumption Data, which is the most commonly used dataset by the researchers to explain 
Over-dispersion will be taken {lemmens1988}. In this dataset, the number of alcohol consumption days in two reference weeks is separately
self-reported by a randomly selected sample of $399$ respondents from the Netherlands in $1983$. Here, the number of days a given individual
consumes alcohol out of seven days a week can be treated as a Binomial variable. The collection of all such variables from all respondents
would be defined as "Binomial Outcome Data".

### Step 1
 
The Alcohol consumption data is already in the necessary format to apply steps $2$ to $5$ and hence, step $1$ can be avoided. The steps 
$2$ to $5$ can be applied only if the dataset is in the form of a frequency table as follows.

```{r ,Step 1_0}
library("fitODBOD")   #Loading packages
print(Alcohol_data)     #print the alcohol consumption data set
sum(Alcohol_data$week1) #No of respondents or N
Alcohol_data$Days       #Binomial random variables or x 
```

Suppose your dataset is not a frequency table as shown in the following dataset called `datapoints`. Then the function `BODextract` 
can be used to prepare the appropriate format as follows.

```{r ,Step 1_1}
datapoints <- sample(0:7, 340, replace = TRUE) #creating a set of raw BOD 
head(datapoints)  #first few observations of datapoints dataset
	
#extracting and printing BOD in a usable way for the package
new_data <- BODextract(datapoints)
matrix(c(new_data$RV, new_data$Freq), ncol=2, byrow = FALSE)
```

### Step 2

As in the second step we test whether the Alcohol Consumption data follows the Binomial distribution based on the hypothesis given below: 

Null Hypothesis : The data follows Binomial Distribution.

Alternate Hypothesis : The data does not follow Binomial Distribution.						

Alcohol Consumption data consists of frequency information for two weeks but only the first week is considered for computation. By doing 
so the researcher can verify if the results acquired from the functions are similar to the results acquired from previous researchers work. 

```{r,Step 2_1}
BinFreq<-fitBin(Alcohol_data$Days, Alcohol_data$week1)
print(BinFreq)
```

Looking at the p-value it is clear that null hypothesis is rejected at $5\%$ significance level. This indicates that data doesn't fit the 
Binomial distribution. The reason for a Warning message is that one of the expected frequencies in the results is less than five. Now we 
compare the actual and the fitted Binomial variances.

```{r, Step 2_2}
#Actual variance of observed frequencies
var(rep(Alcohol_data$Days, times = Alcohol_data$week1))
#Calculated variance for frequencies of  fitted Binomial distribution 
var(rep(BinFreq$bin.ran.var, times = fitted(BinFreq)))
```

The variance of observed frequencies and the variance of fitted frequencies are $6.253788$ and $1.696035$ respectively, which indicates
Over-dispersion. 

### Step 3 and 4

Since the Over-dispersion exists in the data now it is necessary to fit the Binomial Mixture distributions Triangular Binomial, Beta-Binomial,
Kumaraswamy Binomial, Gamma Binomial, Grassia II Binomial, GHGBB and McGBB using the package, and select the best-fitted distribution using
Negative Log likelihood value, p-value and by comparing observed and expected frequencies. Modelling these distributions are given in the next
sub-sections.

#### a) Triangular Binomial distribution.

The estimation of the mode parameter $c$ can be done by using the `EstMLETriBin` function, and then the estimated value has to be 
applied to `fitTriBin` function to check whether the data fit the Triangular Binomial distribution. 

```{r,Step 3_a}
#estimating the mode
modeTB <- EstMLETriBin(Alcohol_data$Days, Alcohol_data$week1) 
coef(modeTB)  #printing the estimated mode

#printing the Negative log likelihood value which is minimized
NegLLTriBin(Alcohol_data$Days, Alcohol_data$week1,modeTB$mode)
```

To fit the Triangular Binomial distribution for estimated mode parameter the following hypothesis is used

Null Hypothesis :&The data follows Triangular Binomial Distribution.

Alternate Hypothesis:& The data does not follow Triangular Binomial Distribution.				

```{r,Step 4_a}
#fitting the Triangular Binomial Distribution for the estimated mode value
fitTriBin(Alcohol_data$Days, Alcohol_data$week1, modeTB$mode)
```

Since the $p-value$ is $0$ which is less than $0.05$ it is clear that the null hypothesis is rejected, and the estimated Over-dispersion is
$0.2308269$. Therefore, it is necessary to fit a better flexible distribution than the Triangular Binomial distribution. 

#### b) Beta-Binomial distribution.

To estimate the two shape parameters of the Beta-Binomial distribution  Methods of Moments or Maximum Likelihood estimation can be used.
Using the function `EstMLEBetaBin`(wrapper function of `mle2` from package `bbmle`) the Negative Log likelihood value will be minimized. 
In order to estimate the shape parameters $a$ and $b$, initial shape parameter values have to be given by the user to this function. These
initial values have to be in the domain of the shape parameters. Below given is the pair of estimates for initial values where $a=0.1$ and
$b=0.1$.

```{r,step 3_b}
#estimating the shape parameters a,b
#estimate = EstMLEBetaBin(x = Alcohol_data$Days,freq = Alcohol_data$week1,a = 0.1, b = 0.1)
#estimate@min #extracting the minimized Negative log likelihood value 
#extracting the estimated shape parameter a	, b
#a1 = bbmle::coef(estimate)[1] ; b1 = bbmle::coef(estimate)[2]  
#print(c(a1,b1))        #printing the estimated shape parameters
```

To fit the Beta-Binomial distribution for estimated (Maximum Likelihood Estimation method) shape parameters the following hypothesis is used 

Null Hypothesis : The data follows Beta-Binomial Distribution by the Maximum Likelihood Estimates.

Alternate Hypothesis: The data does not follow Beta-Binomial Distribution by the Maximum Likelihood Estimates.							

```{r,step 4_b}
#fitting Beta Binomial Distribution for estimated shape parameters
fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days, Alcohol_data$week1, a1, b1)
```

#### c) Kumaraswamy Binomial distribution.

#### d) Gamma Binomial distribution.

#### e) Grassia II Binomial distribution.

#### f) GHGBB distribution.

#### g) McGBB distribution.

### Step 5
